README.md: The Starter Club Operating SystemVersion: 10.2 (Harmonized Master)Status: Production ReadyClassification: Internal Doctrine🏎️ 1. The Mission (Start Here)We do not build "Compliance Checklists."We build "Roll Cages" for 200mph Businesses.San Francisco startups have a culture of "Move Fast and Break Things." The problem is, they usually break themselves. They die from preventable shocks—founder disputes, lost passwords, server crashes, or tax liens.Starter Club is Civic Infrastructure. We are the Pit Crew.We don't tell them to slow down.We build the structure that allows them to go fast without dying.Our Motto: "Structure Creates Speed."🗣️ 2. The Rosetta Stone (Nomenclature)Strict Rule: Do not use generic SaaS terms. Use the Domain Language below. This applies to variable names in code AND copy in marketing.Standard TermOur Internal/Code NameDescriptionUserDriverThe business owner/founder.Admin/StaffCrew_ChiefOur internal staff who verify data.DashboardThe_CockpitThe main UI view. Displays real-time status.ChecklistChassis_SpecThe list of required documents/tasks.File StoragePaddock_VaultWhere users upload PDFs/Proof.Crisis PlanRun_Flat_ProtocolThe logic that triggers during an emergency.Tier 2 MemberGrid_AccessThe $129/mo recurring subscription.Status: VerifiedRace_ReadyAll systems go (Green).Partner/BrokerScoutReferral partners who get commissions.🏁 LEADERSHIP NOTE:We are building a tool that saves businesses from extinction. The code must be as resilient as the companies we are helping. Build First. Don't Break.⚙️ 3. The Technical Imperatives (For Developers)⛔ Rule #1: NO BOOLEANS for StatusNever use is_verified = true.Why? A document verified in 2024 is useless in 2026. "True" is a lie.The Fix: Use Lifecycle Tracking.status: 'pending'status: 'race_ready_at_[timestamp]'status: 'expired'⏳ Rule #2: The Decay Rate (Rust Never Sleeps)Every Race_Ready item in the Chassis_Spec has a shelf life of 180 Days.The Logic: If current_date - verification_date > 180, the status automatically downgrades from Race_Ready (Green) to Wood (Yellow).The UI: The Driver must see their "Armor" rusting over time. This drives retention.🔐 Rule #3: Zero-Knowledge ArchitectureWe are a "Trust" company.The Constraint: A Crew_Chief (Staff) cannot open a file in a Driver's Paddock_Vault unless the Driver generates a temporary Access Token.The Code: Implement Row Level Security (RLS) immediately.🔄 Rule #4: The Pivot AlgorithmStartups change.If a Driver changes their Industry tag (e.g., from "SaaS" to "Food/Bev"), the system must trigger handleIndustryPivot().This re-maps their Chassis_Spec. Some items remain (e.g., "EIN"), some are archived (e.g., "SaaS SLA").💰 4. The Business Logic (For Sales & Ops)The TiersThe Paddock (Free): DIY Templates. Lead Gen.Grid_Access ($129/mo): The Core Product. Access to The_Cockpit, Simulator, and Paddock_Vault.Factory Team ($8k+): Done-For-You. High ticket.The Scout Program (Referrals)We pay Brokers and VCs to bring us cars to fix.The Logic:$1,000 Flat: Triggered when a referral pays for "Factory Team".10% MRR: Triggered on Grid_Access subscriptions (Trailing 12 Months).The Clawback: If the member churns < 90 days, the commission is voided.🚩 5. The "Simulator" (The Killer Feature)We don't just store PDFs. We test them.The Feature: Users run "Tabletop Scenarios" (e.g., Server Crash, Founder Incapacitated, Viral Traffic Spike).The Check: The system queries the Paddock_Vault.Scenario: "Server Crash."Query: "Do you have backup_provider_login stored?"Result: Pass/Fail.⚖️ 6. Legal, Accounting & Compliance ConstraintsUPL (Unauthorized Practice of Law)Hard Rule: Every generated PDF, Report, or Chassis_Spec audit must automatically append the following footer:"Operational Audit Only. Not Legal or Accounting Advice."The Snapshot DisclaimerCertificates are Static PDFs, not live dashboards. They must be stamped with the Date of Generation and the text:"Valid as of [Date]. Status subject to decay."🚀 Getting StartedBackend: Initialize the DB using Master_JSON_v10.1. Focus on the scout program table.Frontend: Review Master_Storyboard_v10.1. Build The_Cockpit to look like a Formula 1 Telemetry screen.Legal: Ensure the UPL Footer is hard-coded into the report generator PDF library.Build First. Don't Break.
